# World — `sectors.keyx` / `sectors.wldx`

**Status: read and streaming.** The engine loads the grid straight out of the
retail install at runtime.

## Geometry

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Sector grid | 100 × 100 |
| Tiles per sector | 64 × 64 |
| One tile | 53.66563 world units |

## The two files

`world/sectors.keyx` — magic `WLK` v5, a directory of **6050** `KeyxSector`
records at 768 bytes each. It is the same container family as the `.pak`
files: `(4646656 − 256) / 768 = 6050` exactly.

`world/sectors.wldx` — zlib blobs, each inflating to `WldxEntry[4096]` at
**32 bytes per cell** (4096 = 64 × 64, one sector's tiles).

Directory fields located in the `keyx` record:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| 236 | `u32` byte offset into `sectors.wldx` |
| 240 | `u32` compressed size |
| 264 | `u32` decompressed size |

## Walkability

Cell-space walkability is a lookup over Sacred's own region grids, not a
derived collision mesh. The engine implements it in `world/walkable.gd`; the
reference decode is in `tools/verify_ref.py`, and the two are diffed.

Sectors used as the parity sample are deliberately *not* the same list as the
general sector sample — the general list yields zero regions in every entry
(measured, not assumed), which would make the gate unfalsifiable.

`vectoren.bin` is `FunkCode`'s symbol table — 5684 sectors, 0 orphans. See
[script-bytecode.md](script-bytecode.md).

`Triggers.PAK` is `TRG v1` and not a `.pak`; see
[pak-containers.md](pak-containers.md).

Building construction — how pieces are placed and linked, and how the
interior/exterior swap works — is deliberately **not** documented here. Its
settled half is entangled with render-architecture decisions about the port,
which are choices rather than facts about the format.

Provenance: `tools/verify_ref.py` and `engine/world/walkable.gd`, which are the
two independent decoders; findings log rows tagged `sectors.wldx` and `world`.
